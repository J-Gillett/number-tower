Complete the tower so that every square contains a number. The number in each square is the sum of the two squares directly below it.

## Current Progress

### Done...
* Wrote algorithm to solve puzzle
* Generalized algorithm to work on puzzles of different sizes

### Crap to do...
* Work on malformed puzzle recognition
* Create a GUI for the puzzle input & solution
* Make a puzzle-generator

## Synopsis

### Ideas Implemented

* Made algorithm to solve any valid puzzle

### Learning
*This will be where the GUI crap goes*

## Review
*This has not been revisited by future me yet.*
