# number tower
*One of 19 puzzle types found in the 'Puzzle a Day' box from Professor Puzzle. The puzzles seemed like they'd be enjoyable starter projects.*

## puzzle instructions
Complete the tower so that every square contains a number. The number in each square is the sum of the two squares directly below it.

## Current Progress
- [x] Wrote algorithm to solve puzzle
- [x] Generalized algorithm to work on puzzles of different sizes
- [ ] Work on malformed puzzle recognition
  - [ ] Not enough info: track if no changes were made during a loop, if no changes were made the puzzle is malformed
  - [ ] Contradiction: after the puzzle has been completed run through all triplets and ensure they fit conditions
- [ ] Create a GUI for the puzzle input & solution
- [ ] Make a puzzle-generator

## Synopsis

### Ideas Implemented
* Made a data structure for a number tower puzzle 
* Made algorithm to solve any valid puzzle

### Learning
*This will be where the GUI crap goes*

## Review
*This has not been revisited by future me yet.*
